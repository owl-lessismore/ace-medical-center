			<p>The Allied Care Experts Medical Center(ACEMC), is authorized under the Republic of the Philippines, 
				Department of Health, to operate a Level II Secondary Hospital Permit No. 13-318-15-60-H2-2.</p>

				state of the art medical facility, to serve the existing community and locators in the Metro Manila areas 
				and the local population of neighboring towns of Luzon.</p>
			<p>The proponents of ACEMC are a diverse group of 60 founders composed of established Medical Specialisy, 
				Hospital Administrators from prominent hospitals in Manila, management professionals and entrepreneurs.</p>
			<p>ACEMC is headed by a Board of Directors composed of 15 individuals with varied expertise in the Field of Medicine, 
				Hospital Operation and Healthcare Delivery. The Board of Directors are elected yearly by the Stockholders during the 
				Annual Stockholders' Meeting. The Board of Directors is headed by the Chairman of the Board. Under the Board of Directors 
				is the office of the President. Directly reporting to the President are the Medical Director and the Hospital Administrators. 
				The different Department Heads in will report to the Medical Director and the Hospital Administrator respectively.</p>
